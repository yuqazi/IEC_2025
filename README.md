# Project Description

A simple implementation of the classic Mastermind logic game using Python and Tkinter. This project provides a graphical interface where players attempt to guess a hidden sequence of colors within a limited number of attempts.

# Game Overview
In Mastermind, the computer generates a secret code consisting of a sequence of colors. The player must guess the sequence within a number of attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback:

Black peg → correct color in the correct position

White peg → correct color but in the wrong position

Your goal is to figure out the exact color sequence before running out of attempts.

# Features

- GUI built with Tkinter
- Visual board showing previous guesses
- Difficult slider
- Bot to play against
